## Description

In collaboration with my friends, this game was developed in 2021 as our final project for a programming course. It tells the captivating story of an (un)usual egg that, against all odds, survives a fall from its nest. Now, the egg embarks on an adventurous journey to explore the world. The game draws inspiration from the imaginative music video [Exyl - Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=114rxHa0qzo)
